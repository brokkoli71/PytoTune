# PytoTune

## Goal
### Input
There are 2 possible inputs
- Paths to a sound file and a midi file some options (eg what happens if midi has a pause or midi is polyphonic)
- Path to a sound file and a scale (array of relative pitches to the tuning pitch, eg "C major") and a tuning (the pitch of a4, eg 440 Hz). Might do: Support scales that don't repeat in a octave.

### Output
The pitch corrected sound file.

### Motivation
We want to learn how pitch correction works in detail and how it can be efficiently optimized.
But most importantly, we cannot sing and want to create outstanding cloud rap.
